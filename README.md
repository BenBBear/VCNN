# CSE291 Final Project #

Xinyu Zhang: A53095838


The final proposal is [here](https://bitbucket.org/xyz0/cse291_fpga_cv_final_project/raw/e48ee0cbc8ad6b3cb228b393b28d1f3fb2ef80b9/Final_Proposal.pdf).


I plan to implement a convolutional neural network here, that could use pretrained caffe model. 


## Current Status

- Caffe Convertor Finished (Could translate *.caffemodel to a c-header file)
